# Arthropod-Identification-Quiz
A simple web-based identification quiz for a member of the UNC Biology Department. It was developed as a supplement to an existing site which is used in their research. Quiz photos are taken from an external API (https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/api+reference) into a static set of possible quiz photos. Administrative tools allow the set of possible photos to be automatically added to and manually cleaned up as needed.   The main goal of the project was to provide the client with a tool that both introduces citizen scientists to arthropod identification and allows the client to estimate each user's relative reliability at identification. This is important to the client's research as it relies on large data collection from citizen scientists through the rest of the Caterpillars Count! website.
